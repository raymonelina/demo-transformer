# Demo Transformer Package

A simplified implementation of the Transformer Encoder-Decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks.

## Installation
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
    This will create a virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies, including `torch`.

## Usage

### Running the Demo

You can run the `demo.py` script to see a basic forward pass and greedy decoding simulation:

```bash
poetry run python demo.py
